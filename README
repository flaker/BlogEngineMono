This is BlogEngine 2.0 (http://www.dotnetblogengine.net/) transformed to a Web Application in order to work with Monodevelop.

Source code includes minimal changes to work with Mono 2.10 (other workarounds were made by the original authors)

Solution file was saved using Monodevelop 2.4.2 and (little) development is being done on the VM provided by the Mono project on their download page (http://www.go-mono.com/mono-downloads/download.html).

The only purpose of this is to get a fully running BE 2.0 under Mono 2.10 and Apache using mono_mod.
